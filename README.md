# Weather Dashboard

## This repository is for my sixth homework assignment for the University of Washington Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp!

### The goal of this assignment is to utilize skills developed so far to create a personal weather dashboard.

## The Assignment:
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
## What was done:
-Most urgent: I am hoping to fix the issue where the weather icon for the first day of the weather forecast is missing before turning in assignment.
-By using a fetch command I was able to gather data for the current weather conditions as well as the five forecast.
-By utilizing local storage, I was able to keep the user's search history for future reference.
-Within the weather information I included weather icons depicting the weather conditions and set the UV index to change color when the UV conditions reach hazardous levels.

## Future improvements:
-I would like to refine the style further someday.
-The search history function could use some refining (for example, arrange it so that if the user searches for a city more than once, it would only get displayed once instead of multiple times.)

## Here is the weather dashboard:
