# Weather Dashboard

## This repository is for my sixth homework assignment for the University of Washington Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp!

### The goal of this assignment is to utilize skills developed so far to create a personal weather dashboard.

## The Assignment:

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
## What was done:
-By using a fetch command I was able to
